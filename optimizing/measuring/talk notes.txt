seaborn enhances to matplotlib plots like minor gridlines

--------
snippets of code from Michael's talk on Machine Learning scaling and web services (REST server in python, rabbit MQ to manage the queue, consumer in skikit learn which loads a pickled classifier from scikitlearn and populates a database of the results)

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

vect = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer='char', ngram_range=(2,3))
X1_train = ...
pca = RandomizedPCA(n_components=50, whiten=True)
clf = SVC()

text_clf = Pipline([
('vect', vect)
('pca', pca),
('clf', clf)
])

for x in X_train[:10]:
    print ' '.join(unicode(...))
    y = country labels

pca.explained_variance_ratio

# TruncatedSVD is better for use with TFidVectorizer

random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(...)
# helps find the best parameters for a model

# keep track of training set and model training parameters, without relying on pickle in case scikit learn is upgraded

send data to REST API which returns a tracking ID and then the REST API can be queried for updates about that ID (are results ready?)

RabbitMQ
AMQP advanced messaging query platform (publishers and consumers of messages)

Gavin M. Roy -- Rabbit MQ in depth

0MQ is alternative message que

loads a pickled clf (classifier)
