Conference Report
=================

PyCon2014 was inspiring and extremely valuable, expanding our network of technical contacts/resources considerably while starting to give Sharp a presence in the scientific computing community. The talks/tutorials at the top were the ones most valuable to me and Big Data. If you have questions about any of these I'd love to share the knowledge.

Very Valuable
-------------

+ **OSF SciNet: ...Scientific Citation Network** -- Harry Rybacki -- poster and impromptu hallway discussion -- FOSS project archiving metadata about copyrighted works and using NLP to extract information. This software and its algorithms are relevant to the patent NLP ideas John and I have.

+ **Optimizing Python** -- Mike Muller  -- 4 hr tutorial -- lots of tools and practice using them to profile and speed up python code (typically 15x). Excellent material that I'll use often, OK delivery.

+ **Postgresql for Humans** -- Craig Kerstiens (Heroku DBA) -- lots of useful tips in separate document 


Other
-----

- Brendan Rhodes -- EXE from Python -- `export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTEFILES=1` to avoid problems with clean pyc. 30% overhead because interpretted, 85% is due to dynamic typing (5x slower due to indirection to look up types in a multiply)

- Documentation -- can use dexi to RST and then into sphinx to create linked HTML documents with code snippets or doctest result embedded

- helicopter -- $60 helicopter + arduino controller for autonomous teleoperation from python on laptop

- blimp -- sophisticated outdoor navigation and autopilot for Helium blimp for overhead photography

- python EXE -- now possible to build standalone EXE files from python easily
