Conference Report
=================

PyCon2014 was inspiring and extremely valuable, expanding our network of technical contacts/resources considerably while starting to give Sharp a presence in the scientific computing community. The talks/tutorials at the top were the ones most valuable to me and Big Data. If you have questions about any of these I'd love to share the knowledge.

Very Valuable
-------------

+ **OSF SciNet: ...Scientific Citation Network** -- Harry Rybacki -- poster and impromptu hallway discussion -- FOSS project archiving metadata about copyrighted works and using NLP to extract information. This software and its algorithms are relevant to the patent NLP ideas John and I have.

+ **Optimizing Python** -- Mike Muller  -- 4 hr tutorial -- lots of tools and practice using them to profile and speed up python code (typically 15x). Excellent material that I'll use often, OK delivery.

+ **Postgresql for Humans** -- Craig Kerstiens (Heroku DBA) -- lots of useful tips in separate document 

+ **Data Structures** -- Brandon Rhodes -- better understanding of the reasons why numpy structures are faster than python builtin lists (double indirection)

+ **Import-and Decisions** -- Allison Kaptur -- built an import function from scratch and showed how the real import statement works and why it's different from C #include, or java import.

Other
-----

- **Openness** -- John Perry Barlow -- writer for grateful Dead and consultant to CIA, NSA, supporter/funder of Snowden and wikileaks, inspiring pep talk on FOSS, and prediction that personal privacy is already an antiquated concept

- **Ansible** -- Michael DeHaan -- better understanding of roles vs modules and available resources for deploying and managing our website

- **Full Stack Development** -- Kate Hendleston -- just a description of architecture

- **EXE from Python*** -- Brendan Rhodes -- `export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTEFILES=1` to avoid problems with clean pyc. 30% overhead because interpretted, 85% is due to dynamic typing (5x slower due to indirection to look up types in a multiply)

- **Documentation** -- can use dexi to RST and then into sphinx to create linked HTML documents with code snippets or doctest result embedded

- **cheap livingroom helicopters** -- $60 helicopter + arduino controller for autonomous teleoperation from python on laptop

- **python-powered blimps** -- sophisticated outdoor navigation and autopilot for Helium blimp for overhead photography

- **machine learning to make HN readable** -- Ned Jackson Lovely -- simple natural language processing (supervised classification)

- **hello physical world** -- internet of things predictions and architecture descriptions

- **education** -- Jessica McKellar -- awesome, inspiring ideas and statistics about the lack of CS education in High School and how python is slowly shaking up the establishment gathered around Java

- **Games for Science** -- Jessica Hamrick -- impressive live demo of 3D rendering and physics engines in python. valuable new tools.

- **KNN** -- Portia Burton -- well-polished live-coding demo of scikit learn tools

- **iPython Notbooks** -- Julia Evans -- nice example of data analysis using notebooks and pandas to record and share your results

- **Discovering Python** -- David Beazly -- how python saved his sanity when he was locked in a vault of IP for 6 months analyzing patents and software source code. Built a file system to handle it all.
